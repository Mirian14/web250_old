                <p>I, <a href="introduction.html"> MIRIAN DE SOUZA. CARVALHO </a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2024,
                    WEB250,
                    DATABASE DRIVEN WEBSITES with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.<br><br>
                    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the
                    world, and will
                    not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br><br>
                    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for
                    class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.<br><br>
                    I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many
                    examples online
                    or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
                    and will not cutand
                    paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my
                    classmates.<br><br>

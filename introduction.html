                    <strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>
                    Since I started to be curious about the IT world, IT is so broad that I always feel like there is so much to learn every single day. I have been enjoying learning how to code. It is fun!

                    <strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>
                    I had built a computer with my tutor a couple of times. I am still learning everyday about any topic in
                    IT. I have parallel running in my laptop. For those who don’t know what it is. It runs Windows and Mac
                    at the same time on my pc. I have been crazy with those having it at the same time. I figured out that I
                    am not a big fan of Mac.

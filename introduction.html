                to move to the United States to learn a new culture and language.

                <strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>
                Since I started to be curious about the IT world, IT is so broad that I always feel like there is so much to learn every single day. I have been enjoying learning how to code. It is fun!

                <strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>
                I had built a computer with my tutor a couple of times. I am still learning everyday about any topic in IT. I have parallel running in my laptop. For those who don’t know what it is. It runs Windows and Mac at the same time on my pc. I have been crazy with those having it at the same time. I figured out that I am not a big fan of Mac.

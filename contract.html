    <p>I, Mirian De Souza. Carvalho agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2024, WEB250,<br>
        DATABASE DRIVEN WEBSITES with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.<br>
        I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will<br>
        not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.<br>
        As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.<br>
        I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online<br>
        or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cutand<br>
        paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.<br>
        Signed: Mirian De Souza. Carvalho, 28/01/2024</p>

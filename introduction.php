                        <strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>
                        Since I started to be curious about the IT world, I have been learning as much as possible about IT in general. 
                        I have been enjoying my jorney learning how to code. It is so much fun!

                        <strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>
                        I had built a computer with my tutor a couple of times. I am still learning everyday about any
                        topic in
                        IT. I have parallel running in my laptop. For those who donâ€™t know what it is. It runs
                        Windows
                        and Mac
                        at the same time on my pc. I have been crazy having those it at the same time. I figured
                        out that I
                        am not a big fan of Mac.
